- **Project summary:**
  - Welcome! This is the repository for my LING2340 (Data Science for Linguists) term project. The purpose of this project is to do a cross-dialectal analysis of two competing Spanish diminutive suffixes (*-ito*, *-illo*) in terms of productivity (i.e., the extent to which a morphological pattern can be applied to new bases and form new words). In order to quantify productivity, I use statistical measures (e.g., Baayen's *P*), which can provide empirical grounding to descriptive claims made in the literature about the prevalence of each suffix. Lastly, this analysis also considers dialectal variation, given that different varieties of Spanish might not necessarily show the same trends.

- **The data:**
  - The data set used in this project is the [Corpus del Español Web/Dialects](https://www.corpusdelespanol.org/web-dial/), a 2-billion word, POS-tagged corpus that covers all Spanish-speaking countries. It has an online interface where advanced queries can be made and full exploration of the data set can be made by [purchasing a license](https://www.corpusdata.org/spanish.asp).
